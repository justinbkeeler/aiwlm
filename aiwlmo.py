        - Reflect about the thoughts you shared from Survey #1, which were also viewable in Survey #2 before you got here.
        - For context, think of a job role, it can be your actual job or a hypothetical one. What industry are you in? Consider the length of time you have been in the job role.
        - Very important, think of a detailed situation where you **feel excluded** or **ostracized at work**, which is impacting your ability to get a **promotion**. Is it your coworkers and/or a manager causing it? Perhaps it is organizational climate and/or culture? 
        - In your **3rd or 4th response**, you must inquire with the AI Assistant if you **should keep information away or hide knowledge** from others given the circumstance you have discussed in the situation.
        - You are allowed to respond 5 times to the AI Assistant in the "What's Dimming your Shine Today area.
        - After you are finished, copy and paste the User/AI Conversation Transcript (all of the output generated from the AI and yourself) into the appropriate space in Survey #2.
