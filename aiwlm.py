        - Reflect about the thoughts you shared from Survey #1, which were also viewable in Survey #2 before you got here.
        - For context, think of a job role you would like to have and a company. Consider some element of time at the company (how long have you been there?).
        - Think of a situation where you **feel excluded** or **ostracized at work**, which is impacting your ability to get a **promotion**. Is it your coworkers and/or a manager causing it? 
        - In your **3rd or 4th response**, you must inquire with the AI Chatbot if you **should keep information away or hide knowledge** from others given the circumstance you have discussed.
        - You are allowed to respond 5 times with the AI Chatbot in the "What's Dimming your Shine Today area.
        - After you are finished, copy and paste the transcript (all of the output generated from the AI and yourself) into the appropriate space in Survey #2.
